ABOUT

"It's important to think good, speak good, and do good." Yet, it's also true 
that effective philanthropy takes a lot of time and creativity. That's where 
we come in.

We are Triton Conceptualize. We provide technical development services for 
non-profits in the greater San Diego area. We are a student organization at 
the University of California, San Diego aiming to do good for those aspiring
to do the same.
